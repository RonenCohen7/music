                Carey was born on March 27, 1969,[a] in Huntington, New York.
Her name is derived from the song "They Call the Wind Maria", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon.
She is the youngest of three children born to Patricia (née Hickey), a former opera singer and vocal coach of Irish descent, and Alfred Roy Carey, an aeronautical engineer of both African-American and Afro-Venezuelan lineage.
The last name "Carey" was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco Núñez, after he emigrated to New York.[9][6] Patricia's family disowned her for marrying a black man. Racial tensions prevented the Carey family from integrating into their community.
While they lived in Huntington, their neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car. After her parents' divorce, Carey had little contact with Alfred, and Patricia worked several jobs to support the family. Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three,
often imitating her mother's take on Verdi's opera Rigoletto in Italian.
Her older sister Alison moved in with their father while Mariah and her elder brother Morgan lived with their mother.
During her years in elementary school, she excelled in the arts, 
such as music and literature. Carey began writing poetry and lyrics 
while attending Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, 
New York, where she graduated in 1987.
Carey began vocal training under the tutelage of her mother.
Though she was a classically trained opera singer,
Patricia Carey never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera. Mariah Carey recalled that she had "never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel.'
I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me."
In high school, Mariah Carey was often absent because of her work as a demo singer.
This led to her classmates giving her the nickname Mirage Working in the Long Island music scene gave her opportunities to work with musicians such as Gavin Christopher and Ben Margulies,
with whom she co-wrote material for her demo tape. After moving to New York City,
she worked part-time jobs to pay the rent and completed 500 hours of beauty school.
Carey moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with four female students as roommates.
She landed a gig singing backup for freestyle singer Brenda K. Starr.
